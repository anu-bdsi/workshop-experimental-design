They randomly select 80 plants from the same species and assign the two treatments to 40 plants each. The researchers measure the height and number of leaves of the plants after two months to assess the impact of the new fertilizer.\n\nStudy A\nWe can specify the above design using edibble package in R as below. What do you notice about the treatment allocation? Could this be problematic? Why?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nStudy B\nYou’ve been told that the plants are grouped into 4 blocks where each block contains 20 pots. One plant is grown in each pot. The researchers want to make sure that each block has an equal number of plants from each treatment group. They also want to randomize the treatment allocation within each block. How would you design this experiment? Using tidyverse or otherwise, count how many plants are assigned to each treatment group within each block after you have your design layout.\n\n\nSample solution\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nStudy C\nYou’ve now been told that the researchers want an additional temperature (standard or high) treatment factor.

This time though consider what your statistical analysis plan may be.
