## 👋 Welcome 

This is a training workshop for BIOL8001 students but extended to also 
staff and students affiliated with the Australian National University (ANU) offered by the ANU Biological Data Science Institute (BDSI). 

This workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles of experimental design and the analysis of experimental data. Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of R and linear models prior to the start of the workshop. 


## 🎯 Learning objectives 

Upon completion of this workshop, participants should be able to:

{{< include slides/_learning-objectives.qmd >}}


## 🔧 Preparation 

Please ensure that you download and install 

- the latest version of [R](https://cran.csiro.au/),
- the latest version of [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or [Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/releases), and 
- the following packages by opening RStudio Desktop or Positron, then copy and paste the command below in the Console section, pushing Enter after pasting.

```r
install.packages(c("edibble", "broom"))
```

- For Window users, you may need to [install Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to install R packages.




```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(webexercises)
library(tidyverse)
ex_tabset <- function(id) {
  paste0("[<i class='fas fa-pen-square'></i> Self test with Exercise ", id, "](#tabset-1-", id, "-tab){onclick=",
         'document.getElementById(', "'tabset-1-", id, "-tab').click();",
         '}')
}
slide_title <- function(id) {
  paste0("[", 
         rmarkdown::yaml_front_matter(paste0("slides/slide", id, ".qmd"))$title,
         "](slides/slide", id, ".html){target='_blank'}")
}

LOs <- readLines("slides/_learning-objectives.qmd")
LOs <- LOs[LOs!=""]
LOs <- stringr::str_replace(LOs, "- ", "")

checklist <- function(x) {
  paste0("::: {.callout-note}\n\n", 
         "## Reflect on learning objectives \n\n",
         "You should be able to:\n",
         paste0("<ul class='checkbox'>", paste(paste0("<li><input type='checkbox'> ", x, "</li>"), collapse = "\n\n"), "</ul>\n\n:::"))

}
